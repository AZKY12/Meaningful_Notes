# Meaningful Notes 📓

**Meaningful Notes** is my first full-fledged Android application, designed as a part of my university mobile application development mini-project. This app simplifies note-taking while offering enhanced functionality with built-in dictionary lookups for definitions, synonyms, and antonyms.

## Features ✨
- **Seamless Data Management**: Powered by Firebase for real-time synchronization and secure storage.
- **Integrated Dictionary**: Uses the Free Dictionary API to provide instant word definitions, synonyms, and antonyms with a long press on words.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimalist and clean design for an enhanced note-taking experience.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Firebase**: For backend database management.
- **Free Dictionary API**: For real-time word lookups.
- **Android Studio**: Developed using Java and XML.

## How It Works 🚀
1. Create, edit, and delete notes easily within the app.
2. Long-press a word to access its meaning, synonyms, and antonyms.
3. Store all notes securely on Firebase and access them across devices.
